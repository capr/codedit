- block selection
- reflow (ctrl+R)

- integrate hunspell
- undo/redo stack serialization
- simultaneous edits
	- ctrl+click creates multiple cursors and movement and typing is available to all
	- ctrl+select creates multiple selections that can be copy/pasted
- move selection (or current line) up/down with the mouse
- select by click-dragging over the line numbers column
	- select entire line by clicking?
	- change mouse pointer to margin.cur?
- double click on selected word selects line
- how to select a paragraph? double click on selected line? triple click on selected word? ctrl+A ?

- carets:
	- caret jumps - when must scroll, scroll longer so the caret can move longer before scrolling again.

- autodetect tabs mode and tabsize
	- skip empty lines
	- count the number of lines that use tabs exclusively for indentation
	- count the number of lines that use spaces exclusively for indentation
	- count the number of lines that use a mixture of tabs and spaces for indentation
	- count the number of lines that use tabs inside the line
	- count the number of lines that use multiple spaces inside the line

- rendering:
	- long lines - display a limit bar or mark the excess with a text style
	- syntax highlighting with embedded lexers (js and css in html etc.)
	- bracket matching highlighting (needs help from the lexer: either to get the tokens or at least to ignore comments)
		- make an engine independent of lexers
	- view whitespace
	- mark special chars and invalid unicode chars
	- annotations (tooltips)
	- text styles: strike-through, underline, dashed/dotted/squiggle underline, selection rectangle,
	- animated scrolling like in sublime text (actually that's pretty annoying)
	- spell checking (configurable to apply only to comments and strings)
	- minimap like sublime text
	- zooming
