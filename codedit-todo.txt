- simultaneous edits
	- ctrl+click creates multiple cursors and movement and typing is available to all
	- ctrl+select creates multiple selections that can be copy/pasted
- move selection (or current line) up/down with the mouse
- select by click-dragging over the line numbers column
	- select entire line by clicking?
	- change mouse pointer to margin.cur?
- double click on selected word selects line
- how to select a paragraph? double click on selected line? triple click on selected word? ctrl+A ?

- carets:
	- caret jumps - when must scroll, scroll longer so the caret can move longer before scrolling again.

- autodetect tabs mode and tabsize
	- skip empty lines
	- count the number of lines that use tabs exclusively for indentation
	- count the number of lines that use spaces exclusively for indentation
	- count the number of lines that use a mixture of tabs and spaces for indentation
	- count the number of lines that use tabs inside the line
	- count the number of lines that use multiple spaces inside the line

- rendering:
	- long lines - display a limit bar or mark the excess with a text style
	- syntax highlighting with embedded lexers (js and css in html etc.)
	- bracket matching highlighting (needs help from the lexer: either to get the tokens or at least to ignore comments)
		- make an engine independent of lexers
	- view whitespace
	- mark special chars and invalid unicode chars
	- annotations (tooltips)
	- text styles: strike-through, underline, dashed/dotted/squiggle underline, selection rectangle,
	- animated scrolling like in sublime text (actually that's pretty annoying)
	- spell checking (configurable to apply only to comments and strings)
	- minimap like sublime text
	- zooming


CODEDITOR
---------
issues:
	- merged key bindings for editor and app. editor gets key bindings that it has no commands for.


- file tabs
	- drag to reorder
	- top or bottom display
- customization:
	- global, local (per-project), per-filetype config file.
	- reload config on the fly when saving the config file.
- hi-level feats
	- create tooltip list from the syntax hightlighter
	- integrate hunspell
	- integrate a Lua linter
- autocompletion
- calltips
- file change detection
- auto-backup (with undo/redo stack?)


QUESTIONS
---------
- find/replace macros:
	- make a table based on separators (see automatic table formatting above)
- bookmarks:
	- how to manage writing code and browsing the same code (but different parts of it) at the same time? split view?
		- idea: simple shortcut to go back to where the cursor was last time you were typing (i always use ctrl+z/ctrl+y)


features I never use
	- macros
	- printing (so 50s)
	- code folding (maybe something like autofolding/unfolding with a side window for fold contents?)
	- line wrapping
	- multiple selections
